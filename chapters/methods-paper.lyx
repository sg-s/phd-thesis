Measuring and controlling odorant stimuli
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study of sensory neurons, especially primary sensory cells, requires
 the ability to precisely control and measure the stimulus applied.
 In the study of vision and audition, the ease of generation and measurement
 of light and sound stimuli have led to a detailed understanding of how
 primary visual and auditory neurons encode visual and auditory stimuli.
 Olfactory stimuli are harder to deliver than sound or light, and even harder
 to measure.
 This is because olfactory stimuli consist not of energy but of small, volatile
 molecules of bewildering variety that have to be mechanically transported
 from the source, typically through the air, to the olfactory receptor neuron.
 Furthermore, odorant molecules interact extensively with their environment,
 including during transport from the odorant source to the sensory neuron.
 These interactions, that depend on odorant identity, have been shown to
 result in a diversity of temporal structures of identically delivered stimuli,
 that can affect the response kinetics of receptor neurons

In this work, we propose methods to deliver and measure odorant stimuli
 that can be used by researchers studying olfaction.
 These methods do not require any bespoke hardware; instead, they rely on
 two off-the-shelf components (a fast

Delivering odorants: olfactometer design

\begin_layout Standard
There exists a variety of methods of delivering odorants.
 Figure

 shows a sample of the zoo of olfactometers (devices for delivering odorants)
 that have been developed to deliver odorants in experimental preparations.
 While the full assortment of olfactometers is too rich to comprehensively
 survey here, all olfactometers can be classified into a few basic types
 based on:

Odorant phase.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Odorants can be in liquid phase, pure or diluted, or can be contained on
 a solid substrate like a filter paper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These design decisions come with intrinsic tradeoffs.
 Positioning the valve upstream of the valve means that no odorant is directly
 in contact with the valve, and that in principle, the valve is not contaminated
 by the odorant (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:olfactometer-zoo"

\end_inset

a).
 This has led previous work to use a single valve with many different odorants,
 lowering cost and speeding up the process of delivering several different
 odorants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deBruyne:1999uh,Hallem:2006iu"

\end_inset

.
 In this configuration, air flows over and depletes the odorant 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 when the stimulus is being delivered.
 
\begin_inset Marginal
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, odorants can diffuse when there is no flow, contaminating valves
 upstream of odorants
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This has the advantage of conserving odorant, as all odorant that enters
 gas phase is delivered to the preparation, a feature that could be useful
 when small quantities of odorant are used, for example, when the odorant
 is expensive or hard to produce, like a pheromone.
 Positioning the valve upstream of the odorant also necessarily introduces
 transients in the signal, as the odorant-vapor system is never at steady
 state.
 On the other hand, positioning the valve downstream of the odorant (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:olfactometer-zoo"

\end_inset

b, c) means that the odorant flows through the valve, necessitating using
 a different valve for every odorant to avoid cross-contamination.
 The costs of choosing to place valves downstream of odorants, both of material
 and time, can be significant if hundreds of odorant-receptor combinations
 are to be tested, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hallem:2004ht,Hallem:2006iu,Kreher:2005va,Mathew:2013ic"

\end_inset

.
 Since the valve is downstream of the odorant, air always flows over the
 odorant, and the valve diverts this odorized airstream either to waste
 (normally), or to the preparation.
 While this design consumes more odorant, the liquid odorant in its chamber
 can reach steady state with the vapor in the chamber, and the state of
 the valve downstream of the odorant does not disturb this equilibrium,
 which could lead to more reproducible stimuli.

\begin_layout Standard
The topology of the olfactometer also determines whether diverting the odorized
 airstream into the main airstream necessarily leads to changes in the airspeed
 of the main flow.
 Unless explicitly compensated for, introducing a new channel into the main
 airstream will increase the airspeed at the outlet, which may be undesirable
 for some organisms or experiments.
 A simple way to compensate for this increase in the airstream is to use
 another valve to switch between an additional clean airstream and the odorized
 stream, as in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:olfactometer-zoo"

\end_inset

d.
 Special valves with two inputs and outputs are typically used, as pairing
 two valves is often impractical due to variations in the resistances from
 valve to valve, that make symmetric switches hard to achieve (Fig.

 so prepared contain odorant in the gas phase that evaporates from the filter

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deBruyne:1999uh,Hallem:2006iu"

\end_inset

 An alternative is to use a vial containing a larger quantity of the diluted
 odorant liquid, either with a very small headspace (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:olfactometer-zoo"

\end_inset

e), as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nagel:2011jj"

\end_inset

, to ensure that the headspace gas phase concentration is dominated by the
 bulk of the liquid odorant, or with a larger headspace, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kim:2010ds"

\end_inset

, to create a large volume of odorized air that can be pushed towards the
 preparation (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:olfactometer-zoo"

\end_inset

d).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diluting odorants in liquid phase using mineral or paraffin oil leads to
 intrinsic non-reproducibility, since every passage of air over the mixture
 depletes the liquid phase concentration of the odorant and the diluent
 to different extents.
 In the extreme case, mineral oil and paraffin are practically nonvolatile
 and every passage of air over depletes the odorant but not the diluent.
 Since the gas phase concentration of odorant in the headspace depends on
 the liquid phase concentration of odorant in a region close to the boundary
 layer, the gas phase concentration of the odorant continuously decreases
 with time.
 One way to ameliorate this depletion is to use a very large volume of odorant
 mixture, and to stir the mixture continuously 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Martelli:2013it"

\end_inset

.
 Stirring expands the effective boundary layer of the mixture, and enables
 the gas phase concentration of the headspace to track the liquid phase
 concentration more closely.
 However, stirring odorants may be impractical in some applications, especially
 in the cramped and electrically sensitive environment of an electrophysiology
 rig, and doesn't ultimately solve the problem of odorant depletion.

Delivering odorants: stimulus waveforms

\begin_layout Standard
Odorant stimuli can be defined by their chemical identity, amplitude and
 temporal structure.
 Choice of odorant, and their concentration define the first two features.
 Pulses of odorant have been used as a common stimulus waveform 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clyne:1997eh,Larsson:2004bx"

\end_inset

, as they are easily generated by briefly turning on a valve that directs
 odorized air to the preparation.
 These simple stimuli reveal whether the neuron of interest responds to
 the odorant tested or not, and can also reveal the kinetics of response
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deBruyne:1999uh,Hallem:2004ht"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More complicated stimuli are difficult to generate due to two reasons: (i)
 the evaporation of volatile odorants makes delivering long stimuli challenging
 and (ii) a valve has only two positions, on or off, limiting the temporal
 structure of the odorant stimulus.
 Various studies have worked around these limitations to deliver more complex
 odorant stimuli.
 Using large volumes of liquid odorant to fight depletion, some studies
 have used a valve to randomly turn on and off an odorant airstream, generating
 a random binary signal that has been used to characterize the response
 properties of ORNs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "French:2007js,Schuckel:2008gz,Martelli:2013it,Nagel:2011jj"

\end_inset

 While stimuli generated this way are typically bimodal, corresponding to
 on and off states of the valves, unimodal stimulus distributions can be
 achieved with combinations of valve switching time and some odorants with
 slower intrinsic kinetics

Another approach is to use a visible tracer and measure the stimulus optically.

 odorant stimuli is key

 The PID works by sucking odorized air into a small chamber, where a

 light ionizes molecules in the sample.
 These ions set up a current between two charged plates, which is converted

 We use a PID in this study to measure odorant stimuli, as it is a fast,
 approximately linear, and general-purpose instrument that is easy to use.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is commonplace in olfactory studies to not measure the stimulus,
 and to compare responses to liquid-phase dilutions of the odorant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, measuring the stimulus presented to ORNs is key to quantitatively describing
 their response, and relying on liquid phase concentrations can bias characteriz
ations of their response phenomenology.
 For example, consider a typical dose-response experiment where ethyl acetate
 stimuli of varying concentration are presented to a ab3A ORN.
 Peak ORN responses exhibit a sigmoidal relationship with the log of the
 liquid phase dilution (Fig.

 However, simultaneous measurement of the stimulus using a PID (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the gas phase concentration is not linear with the liquid phase concentration,

 Odorants delivered this way exhibit a broad range of stimulus kinetics

), that depend on the chemical identity of the odorant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Since the conditions of the delivery are identical across odorants, we
 reasoned that the origin of the diversity of stimulus kinetics is variation
 in the interactions of the odorant with the surfaces of the delivery system,
 and simple physical properties of the odorants like their vapor pressure.
 We therefore set out to develop a simple model of odorant evaporation from
 the filter paper, interaction with the surfaces of the delivery system,
 and transport by the air flowing through the delivery system.

 an absolute value of the gas phase concentration of odorants.
 Since different odorants have different ionization potentials, identical
 gas phase concentrations of different odorants can lead to different measuremen
ts from the PID.
 Calibration of the PID, the process of converting the reported voltage
 into an absolute number of molecules of odorant, is thus important if the
 scale of the stimulus applied is to be taken into account.
 Many studies that use PIDs to monitor gas phase concentrations of odorants
 do not calibrate the PID

.
 However, these are expensive, and shift the problem of calibration to another
 device.
 Another approach is to assume the odorant headspace in the olfactometer
 is saturated, and use Raoult's and Henry's Law to estimate the gas phase
 concentration of the odorant, and then extrapolate to fast changes reported
 by the PID.
 Such an approach has been used as is

 It is not known how valid the assumption of saturated headspace is, and
 using another gas of known concentration does not contribute to the accuracy
 of the estimation of the absolute gas phase concentration of the test odorant.

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we propose a simple method to calibrate the PID to any odorant that
 it can detect.
 This method is easy to perform, does not require additional equipment,
 calibrated gases of known concentration, or make any assumptions about
 the saturation of headspace in the olfactometer.
 It works by depleting a known volume of pure odorant, and integrating the
 total PID signal over the course of depletion.
 Since the number of molecules in the pure odorant sample can be estimated
 precisely (from its volume and published formula weight and density), the
 PID signal per unit time can be converted into the number of molecules
 leaving the olfactometer per unit time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calibrate our PID to ethyl acetate odorant, we placed 100 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\mu L}$
\end_inset

 of pure odorant in a 30 mL scintillation vial with a screw top lid with
 two tubes.
 One tube was fed into a clean airstream with a 2000 mL/min flow rate, and
 the other led to a

 that forced air through the scintillation vial at a fixed rate.
 A PID measured the gas phase concentration at the outlet of the olfactometer,
 and data was collected when the air started flowing over the odorant.
 The schematic of the olfactometer is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

a.
 We flowed air through the scintillation vial till all odorant in the vial
 was completely depleted (which was when the PID reading returned to the
 pre-stimulus level), and repeated this measurement for a number of fixed
 flow rates through the scintillation vial.
 The total volume of air required to evaporate the odorant decreased with
 the flow rate (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:methods_calibration"

\end_inset

b), reflecting nonlinear relationships between the rate of evaporation and
 the flow rate.
 Correspondingly, smaller flow rates took longer to completely deplete the
 odorant (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:methods_calibration"

\end_inset

c), and peak and steady state value of the PID signal increased with flow
 rate through the scintillation vial.
 If the PID captured all the molecules of odorant emerging from the olfactometer
, and ionized all of them, the integrated PID signal would be a constant,
 independent of the flow rate, and correspond to the total number of molecules
 of odorant in the vial.
 However, we observed that the total PID signal decreased with the flow
 rate (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:methods_calibration"

\end_inset

d), an effect we attributed to flow-rate dependent partial capture of emission
 by the PID.
 To compensate for this, we fit an interpolant to this data (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

e), confirming that mapping from PID signals to number of molecules was
 consistent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then computed the odorant flux as a function of the flow rate, by estimating
 the slope of the cumulative odorant curves in a relatively stable region
 (Fig.

 Finally, we can combine these measurements to plot odorant flux

 the PID signal, to generate a function that maps PID values onto odorant
 flux.
 Odorant flux here is reported in units of mol/s, so constitutes an estimate

 and show find that both curves are approximately linear (Fig.

 Typically, pulses of odorant have been delivered by forcing air through
 cartridges containing a filter paper with a small quantity of odorant diluted
 in Paraffin Oil.
 Stimulus duration is controlled by the length of time air is forced through
 the cartridge, and stimulus intensity is controlled by the liquid phase
 dilution of the odorant in Paraffin Oil.
 This means that different cartridges have to be prepared for different
 desired stimulus intensities, making the process potentially cumbersome.
 Furthermore, since odorants contaminate the entire inner surface of the
 cartridge, cartridges typically are discarded after a certain number of
 uses

 This approach has several advantages over the earlier method.
 First, since pure odorant is used, evaporation of the odorant does not
 change the effective concentration of the odorant that remains in the scintilla
tion vial, and the gas phase concentration of the headspace in the vial
 remains constant, as long as there is some odorant left in the vial.
 Second, it greatly simplifies the apparatus needed to deliver odorants:
 Pasteur pipettes, filter papers, etc.
 are not needed, and there is no need to precisely measure the amount of
 odorant in the scintillation vial.
 Third, pulses of several intensities can be delivered with the same apparatus,
 enabling automation of typical experiments.
 Finally, this approach creates no waste, as all parts of the system can
 be re-used, including the scintillation vial.
 When odorant is depleted, the scintillation vial can be refilled with more
 pure odorant.
 Pulses delivered using this method are more reliable from trial to trial
 than the earlier method, and do not show any significant decay in amplitude
 over 20 trials (Fig.

The primary reason to deliver odorant pulses of different intensities to
 a neuron is to determine its dose response curve.
 These results suggest that there are two approaches to this problem.
 First, one can embrace the intrinsic decay in pulse amplitude associated
 with the older method, and measure the stimulus

 response, and use the measured stimulus to determine the dose-response
 curve.
 Second, one can use MFCs and pure odorants to generate reproducible pulses,

How to deliver fluctuating odorant signals 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time series of fluctuating odorant signals have been used to as an efficient
 way to characterize the response properties of ORNs.
 Paired recordings of a time series of some fluctuating odorant signal and
 the response of a neuron can be used to recover the linear kernel that
 best describes the transformation from the stimulus to the response.
 Such a linear kernel can be used to predict the time series of response
 of that neuron to a novel stimulus that the neuron has not previously been
 exposed to, and even to predict the response of the neuron to a stimulus
 from a second odorant
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A favorable stimuli to use for this is Gaussian white noise.
 This stimulus is Gaussian distributed, and is uncorrelated from any one
 time point to another.
 Its tight autocorrelation structure allows sampling all frequencies of
 the neuron response (see

), limits on the airspeed used in the delivery system, and finite timescales
 of the components of the delivery system introduce correlations into any
 odorant stimulus.
 Furthermore, since the easiest way to control an odorant signal is to use
 a valve to divert an odorized airstream towards or away from the preparation,
 early work using fluctuating odorant signals to identify linear kernels
 from ORN responses used binary odorant stimuli where the stimulus was either
 on or off

key "Martelli:2013it,French:2014ek,Schuckel:2008cd,Schuckel:2008gz,Nagel:2011jj"

 This creates a typically a bimodal stimulus distribution, with the lower
 peak close to 0, and the larger peak at some value that can be controlled
 by the concentration of the odorized airstream (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

a-b).
 The correlation time of the signal can be controlled by varying the switching
 time of the valve, and for volatile odorants that do not interact strongly
 with the surfaces of the olfactometer, correlation times as fast as 30
 ms can be realized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Martelli:2013it"

.
 In these binary stimuli, the mean stimulus is typically rarely realized,
 and the responses of the neuron are dominated by the large, rapid increases
 of odorant on valve opening.

 Specifically, mono-modal distributions can be easily realized.

How to deliver Gaussian odorant signals with different means and variances
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adaptation is a process by which the amplitude and kinetics of the responses
 of a system change with the statistics of the signal presented.
 In principle, any moment of the stimulus distribution could induce adaptive
 changes.
 The visual system has been shown to adapt strongly to the first to the
 first two moments of stimulus distributions – the mean and the variance
 – with much smaller changes in response arising from changes in stimulus
 kurtosis and skew.
 Here, we demonstrate how stimuli that are dominated by changes in only
 moment of the distribution can be generated, while keeping other features
 of the stimulus unchanged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest way to generate odorant stimuli with varying means is to use
 a MFC to vary airflows through a vial containing pure odorant.
 We started with the ansatz that the flux of odorant in the odorized airstream
 scales with the fraction of odorized air in the main airstream, or the
 PID signal 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S\sim\frac{Q_{\textrm{odor}}}{Q_{\textrm{odor}}+Q_{\textrm{main}}}\label{eq:mfc-ansantz}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 represents the flow rate.
 We can therefore construct a set of control signals to the MFC using eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:mfc-ansantz"

\end_inset

 and measure the resulting signals.
 Deviations in the signals can be corrected by scaling and shifting the
 MFC control signals iteratively till a stimulus distribution sufficiently
 close to the desired distribution is achieved.
 A set of odorant signals generated this way using ethyl acetate is shown
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Since the temporal structure of the control signals driving the MFC is

 is similar across intensities (Fig.

Experiments where the variance of the stimulus is modulated, with a fixed
 mean, typically involve switching between epochs where the variance is
 low and where the variance is high.
 A simple way to achieve odorant signals where signal variance alternates
 between high and low values is to duplicate the apparatus used previously,
 but drive the two MFCs with signals identical except for their variance.
 A valve can be used to switch between the two airstreams, creating epochs
 with high variance (from the MFC driven with control signals with large
 variance) and epochs with low variance (from the other MFC).
 An example of such a stimulus is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

e, where the low-variance epoch lasts from 0-5 s and the high variance epoch
 lasts from 5-10 s.
 The distribution of the stimulus during the two epochs shows that the variance
 is clearly different (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:methods-mu-sigma"

f).
 If the stimuli during the high and low variance epochs are rescaled by
 their variance, the distributions collapse onto each other, showing that
 the low- and high-variance stimuli are similar in distribution (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Comparing the mean and variance of the stimuli during the two epochs (Fig.

\begin_inset Formula $p=0.07$

 Since the two MFCs are driven by control signals that are only rescaled
 versions of each other, the temporal structure of the stimulus in the low-

Flux or concentration detectors?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olfactory neurons are considered to be either concentration detectors, where
 receptors are directly exposed to the external stimulus concentration,
 or flux detectors, where stimulus molecules are accumulated in a peri-receptor
 compartment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kaissling:1998wo"

\end_inset

.
 Are PIDs flux or concentration detectors? The calibration technique we
 proposed converts PID values into a flux, since (i) in the conditions described
 here, a constant flux of odorant molecules is maintained at the outlet
 of the delivery tube; and (ii) the PID sucks in air at a constant rate,
 and constantly removes air from the detection chamber at the same rate.
 Previous studies that have calibrated PIDs have reported PID values converted
 into a instatenous gas phase concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kim:2010ds,Kim:2015dm,Schulze:2015bt"

\end_inset

.
 While a constant flux of odorant molecules emerging from the delivery tube
 may lead to a constant concentration of odorant at a fixed point from the
 outlet (assuming steady state), the translation from flux to concnetration
 is not without assumptions, and probably varies with the geometry of the
 setup, and other factors.
 Moreover, since conservation of odorant implies that the invariant physical
 quantitity of interest is the flux, our calibration procedure naturally
 converts PID readouts into units of flux.

Delivering and measuring mixtures of odorants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odorants do not typically exist in isolation in nature.
 Odors consist of mixtures of odorants, and the specific fractional composition
 of different odorants in an odor mixture can carry important information.
 The measurement and delivery of mixtures of odorants is beyond the scope
 of this study, primarily because there is no unambiguous method to indepdnelty
 measure the amount of different compoennts of an odor mixture using a PID.
 Since the PID sucks in all molecules in the airstream, and sums across
 all the ions in the detection chamber, it is incapable of distinguishing
 between varyiong amounts of different odorants.
 Recent work, however, attempts to work around these challenges and presents
 techniques to deliver mixtures of odorants
