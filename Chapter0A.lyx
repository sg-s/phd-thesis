\begin_layout Section
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olfactory stimuli can be decomposed into a few basic features, like the
 chemical identity of the odorants in the odor, their concnetration, and
 the kinetics of the stimulus.
 
\begin_inset ERT

acfp{ORN}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 appear to be able to capture all these features.
 The chemical identity of the odorant is captured by which olfactory neurons
 respond, since different neurons have different receptors.
 The concentration of the odorants in the stimulus is captured in part by
 the amplitude of neuronal response, and also by the identity of the neurons
 that respond, since different receptors have different sensitivities to
 the same odornt.
 Finally, the temporal structure of the odorant stimulus is encoded in the
 response kientics of neuron response.
 Insects on the wing can encounter odorant stimuli with varying cincbentrations
 and durations, and it is not clear if flies use all these features of the
 stimulus equally to make navigational decisions.

 Recently, the TFA has also been used to study olfaction, either in the
 fixed tethered configuration

 or in rotatable tethered configiration, where flies can actively reoirent
 into or away from an odorised airstream

.
 Since the fly is fixed in place in this assay, it allows delivering and
 measuring olfactroy stimuli and measuring how these olfactroy stimuli modualte
 olfactroy flight behavior.
 In this assay, the behavior of the fly is quantified by changes in the

Results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bhandawat:2010eu"

\end_inset

, I constructed a tethered flight assay where flies are tehtered to insect
 pins and held in front of an airstream in the dark (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-schematic"

\end_inset

for a picture).
 A paired olfactometer used four valves, all upstream of vials containing
 odorant or control, to deliver short pulses of either odorant or control.
 A PID behind the fly captured the odorant delivered to the fly, and allowed
 me to record the stimulus simultenously with the behavior of the fly.

 The wings of the fly cast a shadow on two photo detectors below the fly,
 whose signals can be used to measure the frequnecy and amplitude of the
 fly's wing beats.
 An odorant delivery system (labelled

 Valves switch between two symmetrical airstreams, one with odor (red) or

 waveform on the photodetector cell (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

a).
 Each windbeat cycle produced this characteristic bilobed wave, and the
 height of the waveform was a proxy for the wing beat amplitude, and the
 frequency of this waveform was the wing beat frequency.
 Flies tended to gradually decrease their wing beat amplitude when the airstream
 was turned on (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

b, left panel), though the wing beat amplitude did not change as much ((Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

b, right panel).
 Switching airstreams in the absence of odorant did not evoke any strong
 response, either with the control airstream (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having estabilished that flies do not increase their WBF or WBA in the absence
 of odorant, I then delivered 3 s pulses of four different odors (Apple
 Cider Vinegar, ethyl butyrate, methyl salicylate and ethyl acetate).
 Flies' behavior to these odor pulses were measured interleaved with responses
 to control pulses with no odorant.
 PID measurement of odor stimuli, control stimuli with no odor, and WBF
 responses of flies to these odors are shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

c.
 In all traces, red curves correspond to test trials with odors, and blue
 trials correspond to control trials with no odor.
 For all four odors tested, WBF decreased in control trials where there
 was no odorant (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

c, blue curves) and WBF increased transiently when odor was presented to
 the flies (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

c, red curves).
 These results suggest that flies can detect these odors, and respond to
 encounters with these odors by increasing WBF.

Flight responses to pulses with different amplitudes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does fly behavior vary with the amplitude of odorant signal presented?
 One possibility is that flies execute the same motor program independent
 of the concentration of the odor detected, and that the concentration of
 odorant detected triggers a navigational behavior, but not the details
 of that behavior.
 Another possibility is that flies modulate their behavioral response based
 on the amplitude of the stimulus they detect.
 To distinguish between the two, I delivered pulses of ethyl acetate with
 varying concnetrations to flies and recorded their flight behavior.

\begin_layout Standard
I generated three different amplitudes of ethyl acetate pulses by diluting
 serially in Paraffin Oil (1/10, 1/100 or 1/1000).
 This serial dilution led to a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10$
\end_inset

 fold change in the gas phase concentration delivered to the fly (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-pulse-amplitude"

bottom row).
 Pulses with largest amplitude led to the largest changes in the WBF and
 WBA (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-pulse-amplitude"

\end_inset

first column), while pulses with the smallest amplitude led to the smallest
 changes in the WBF and WBA (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-pulse-amplitude"

\end_inset

last column).
 This suggests that (i) the behavior seen here and in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

 is likely olfactory in origin, and (ii) the concentration of the odor encounter
ed modulates the amplitude and kinetics of the behavioral response.

Flight responses to pulses of different durations

\begin_layout Standard
How does the duration of the odor pulse encountered affect behavioral responses?
 Due to the relatively high speed at which Drosophila fly (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim30$

 cm/s) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

and the relatively narrow width of odor plumes that they would likely encounter

LatexCommand citep
key "Murlis:1981by,Murlis:1992kp,Murlis:2000kk,Justus:2002da"

, flies may experience contact and loss witha plume almost instatneously.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vanBreugel:2014is"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that flies may modulate their behavior even to very brief
 plumes of odorant.
 To test this hypothesis, I presented flies with pulses of ethyl acetate
 odorant with varying durations.

\begin_layout Standard
Flies modulated their WBF and WBA responses with the duration of the pulse
 delivered, with the shortest pulses eliciting the smallest and most transient
 increases in the WBF and WBA (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-durations"

\end_inset

, first column).
 As the duration of the pulse increased, responses grew larger and more
 long lasting (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-durations"

\end_inset

).
 However, since the pulses delivered using this olfactometer are not perfectly
 square (largely due to the fact that the valve is upstream of the odor),
 pulse duration is also strongly correlated with pulse amplitude in this
 experiment.
 Thus, it is not clear if the change in responses seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-durations"

\end_inset

 are due to changes in pulse duration, or due to changes in pulse amplitude,
 or some combination of the two.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Trial-to-trial variations in behavioral response 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, the data presented neglects the variation in behavior from trial
 to trail and pools all trials to present gross averages (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-diff-odors"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-pulse-amplitude"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-durations"

\end_inset

).
 How do fly responses vary from trial to trial? Individual trials from individua
l flies are very noisy, making interpretation of data challenging.
 I therefore averaged across different flies, and plot trends in behavior
 as a function of trial number.
