Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olfactory stimuli can be decomposed into a few basic features, like the
 chemical identity of the odorants in the odor, their concnetration, and
 the kinetics of the stimulus.
 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 appear to be able to capture all these features.
 The chemical identity of the odorant is captured by which olfactory neurons
 respond, since different neurons have different receptors.
 The concentration of the odorants in the stimulus is captured in part by
 the amplitude of neuronal response, and also by the identity of the neurons
 that respond, since different receptors have different sensitivities to
 the same odornt.
 Finally, the temporal structure of the odorant stimulus is encoded in the
 response kientics of neuron response.
 Insects on the wing can encounter odorant stimuli with varying cincbentrations
 and durations, and it is not clear if flies use all these features of the
 stimulus equally to make navigational decisions.

 and modified to study vision, mechanosensation, and the visual control
 of flight

.
 Recently, the TFA has also been used to study olfaction, either in the
 fixed tethered configuration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or in rotatable tethered configiration, where flies can actively reoirent
 into or away from an odorised airstream

.
 Since the fly is fixed in place in this assay, it allows delivering and
 measuring olfactroy stimuli and measuring how these olfactroy stimuli modualte
 olfactroy flight behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next section, I detail my attempts to use this assay to determine
 how flies change their flight behaviour with the identitiy, ampliotude
 and duration of olfactroy stimuli.

Results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bhandawat:2010eu"

\end_inset

, I constructed a tethered flight assay where flies are tehtered to insect
 pins and held in front of an airstream in the dark (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tfa-schematic"

\end_inset

for a picture).
 A paired olfactometer used four valves, all upstream of vials containing
 odorant or control, to deliver short pulses of either odorant or control.
 A PID behind the fly captured the odorant delivered to the fly, and allowed
 me to record the stimulus simultenously with the behavior of the fly.

 The wings of the fly cast a shadow on two photo detectors below the fly,
 whose signals can be used to measure the frequnecy and amplitude of the
 fly's wing beats.
 An odorant delivery system (labelled

 can deliver either pulses of odorant or pulses of clean air to the fly.
 Valves switch between two symmetrical airstreams, one with odor (red) or
 one without, to deliver odorant to the fly with minimial changes in airflow.

 monitoring of the behavior and the stimulus.
 Finally, genetic strategies can be used to delete or replace receptors
 in the fly.
 The timeseries at the bottom shows the typical experiemntal block, where
 a control pulse (with no odorant) is presented first, followed by a test
 pulse with odorant.

Flies flapped their wings spontensouly when suspended in the device, creating

a).
 Each windbeat cycle produced this characteristic bilobed wave, and the
 height of the waveform was a proxy for the wing beat amplitude, and the
 frequency of this waveform was the wing beat frequency.
 Flies tended to gradually decrease their wing beat amplitude when the airstream
 was turned on (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

b, left panel), though the wing beat amplitude did not change as much ((Fig.

 Switching airstreams in the absence of odorant did not evoke any strong
 response, either with the control airstream (Fig.
