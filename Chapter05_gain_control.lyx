Odor landscapes that insects navigate are often not smooth gradients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Instead, turbulent airflows shape odor plumes into intermittent whiffs
 randomly separated by periods of background air (blanks).
 In the absence of reliable spatial gradients, navigating insects may use
 the timing of whiff encounters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, combined with other sensory modalities such as mechanosensation to detect
 wind direction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, to navigate odor plumes towards mates and food.
 Insect olfactory systems face dual challenges in detecting natural odor
 plumes.
 First, the intensity of whiffs is typically distributed according to a
 power law 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Murlis:1992kp"

\end_inset

, with intense whiffs interleaved unpredictably with weak ones 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Riffell:2008hp"

\end_inset

.
 This requires the insect to represent a very large domain of stimulus intensity
 using a relatively narrow response range of its sensors.
 Second, whiff durations and blank durations are also distributed as a power
 law over a wide range of time scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Celani:2014ea"

\end_inset

.
 This lack of characteristic scale in the intensity and timing of whiffs
 makes it challenging to precisely detect and encode individual odor whiffs.
 The encoding problem is aggravated by shifting local statistics of odor
 encounters, which change with wind speed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, position

, or environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 How does the olfactory system manage to encode whiffs of odors whose intensitie
s and timing can vary over such wide ranges? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several features of the olfactory system contribute to encoding odor stimuli
 of different intensities.
 A single odorant can be detected by multiple receptor types, with different
 sensitivities

, selectively amplify weak signals and suppress responses to large signals
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deBruyne:2001ur,Bhandawat:2007ie"

\end_inset

.
 Glomerular mechanisms implement a type of divisive gain control that maintains
 PN sensitivity within the range of changing ORN responses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bhandawat:2007ie,Olsen:2010dc,Olsen:2008kv,Luo:2010fb"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, transduction currents in response to odor pulses scale inversely
 with the intensity of the background signal, consistent with the Weber-Fechner
 Law 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cao:2016jl"

\end_inset

.
 However, whether ORN firing follows a similar scaling is unclear 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cafaro:2016ed,Martelli:2013it"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, although the input-output curve of ORNs to odor stimuli changes with
 odor background, the precise scaling of ORN gain control from stimulus
 to firing rate has not been characterized.

 The speed of the response is enhanced by ORN spike generation, which emphasizes
 changes in transduction currents 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which maintain fast information transmission from ORNs to PNs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 In contrast, adaptation to high intensity stimuli slows down transduction
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nagel:2011jj,Cao:2016jl,Kaissling:1987gva"

\end_inset

, a property that might make it difficult to reliably encode the timing
 of odor encounters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigated in vivo how 
\emph on
Drosophila
\emph default
 ORNs encode encounters with naturalistic odor plumes, which possess the
 dual complication that both whiff intensities and whiff timing are broadly
 distributed.
 To address this question, we first developed an odorant delivery system
 that reproducibly delivered odorants with naturalistic statistics, or approxima
tely Gaussian statistics with controlled means and variances.
 We simultaneously recorded the odorant stimulus (using a fast 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
acf{PID}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and recorded extracellularly from identified ORNs.
 In these studies, we focused on the phenomenology of odorant encoding,
 which can help to constrain the potential molecular mechanisms that implement
 them.
 We found that in response to naturalistic stimuli, ORNs employed front-end
 nonlinearities inherent in receptor saturation to encode broadly distributed
 signals.
 In addition, ORNs could rapidly desensitize following encounters with odorant
 whiffs, dynamically adjusting gain while responding to intermittent odorant
 stimuli.
 On increasing the mean stimulus background, ORNs decreased gain inversely
 with stimulus intensity, consistent with the Weber-Fechner Law.
 This phenomenon could be explained if the disassociation constant 
\emph on
K
\emph default
 of odorant binding scaled with the mean stimulus intensity.
 Supporting this model, we found that gain control to changes in mean was
 localized to LFP signals, suggesting that adaptation occurs at transduction
 in the ORNs, with little contribution from spiking machinery.
 ORN gain also changed in response to changes in stimulus variance, with
 gain changes distributed equally across transduction and spiking.
 Even though the transduction response time slowed down with increasing
 stimulus intensity, the spiking machinery sped up to compensate.
 The result of these complementary kinetic changes was that the firing rate
 response time remained invariant with stimulus intensity, revealing a mechanism
 that could allow ORNs to preserve information about the precise timing
 of odor encounters over a wide range of rapidly changing signal intensities.

 ms on timescales as fast as 500 ms

, we asked if ORNs could change their gain dynamically during responses
 to naturalistic stimuli, amplifying responses to isolated whiffs of odorant,
 and suppressing responses to whiffs following dense clumps of whiffs.

 This means that the LFP signal is generated by the sensing neuron, and
 is upstream of spiking machinery under the conditions tested.
 We therefore used LFP recordings as an imperfect but useful proxy for transduct

 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

a-b) ORN responses to these whiffs were more even, so that responses to
 faint whiffs were amplified more than those to intense whiffs.
 To quantify these differences, we defined the gain of the neuron to be
 the change in the response for a unit change in the stimulus.
 Since ORNs do not respond instantaneously to odorant stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deBruyne:2001ur,deBruyne:1999uh"

\end_inset

, we fit linear filters to best predict the LFP and firing rate from the
 stimulus.
 We used these filters to make linear predictions of the responses from
 the stimuli (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-gaussian-filters"

\end_inset

).
 Changes in gain were therefore defined as deviations from the linear prediction
 of response from the stimulus, similar to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kim:2001vq,Baccus:2002fy"

\end_inset

.
 We visualized these gain changes by plotting the LFP responses against
 linear prediction of the LFP (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-1"

\end_inset

c) and the firing rate against the linear prediction of the firing rate
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

d).
 Each excursion in these plots corresponds to the ORN’s response to a single
 whiff.
 Excursions occurred with different slopes, suggesting that ORN gain changed
 frequently in time.
 Deviations from linearity persisted even when filters computed from Gaussian
 inputs were used to project the stimulus, suggesting that the existence
 of these deviations do not depend on the exact shape of the filter, but
 rather reflect a property of the ORN response not captured by the linear
 model (Fig.

Variations in the gain clearly do not arise from a static output nonlinearity,
 such as one associated with a static linear-nonlinear transformation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Dayan:2001uy"

\end_inset

 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-1"

\end_inset

c-d).
 We reasoned that changes in the gain could arise from input nonlinearities
 due to odor-receptor binding and channel opening.
 To visualize the nonlinearity between the stimulus and response, we plotted
 LFP and firing rate responses to each whiff in the naturalistic stimulus
 as a function of the amplitude of that whiff (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-1"

\end_inset

e-f).
 A clear sigmoidal function is visible in the plot of LFP responses against
 whiff intensity, consistent with a front-end nonlinearity arising from
 receptor-odorant binding.
 However, in both the LFP and firing rates, responses to whiffs with similar
 intensities varied significantly, deviating from a single sigmoidal dose-respon
se curve (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-1"

\end_inset

e-f).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What causes these deviations from the dose-response curve? The simplest
 explanation is that these deviations are due to random variability in the
 responses of the neuron.
 Another possibility is that these deviations are due to variations in the
 stimulus history preceding each whiff.
 To test this hypothesis, we collected whiffs that had similar amplitudes,
 and examined the LFP and firing rate responses they evoked (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-adaptation"

\end_inset

a-b).
 The amplitude of LFP and firing rate responses elicited by these whiffs
 varied inversely with the amplitude of the preceding stimulus: whiffs that
 occurred in isolation (purple) elicited the largest responses, while whiffs
 that followed earlier, large whiffs (blue, red) elicited the smallest responses
, suggesting that ORN responses can be modulated by stimulus history.

What causes this context dependent suppression of responses following preceding
 whiffs? One possibility is a bilobed filter, with one positive and one
 negative lobe.
 Such a filter is partly differentiating, and would lead to attenuated responses
 to the second of two closely spaced whiffs, and has been measured in linear
 models of the firing rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Martelli:2013it,Nagel:2011jj,Kim:2010ds"

.
 Such a mechanism may partly account for context dependent variation in
 firing rates.
 However, stimulus to LFP filters, computed for this stimulus and others,
 are mono-lobed (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nat-stim-NL-model"

), and purely integrating 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, ruling out contributions to dynamic modulation of LFP responses by this
 mechanism.
 A model with a static front-end nonlinearity and a mono-lobed filter fit
 to the LFP also cannot reproduce context-dependent adaptation observed
 in the LFP (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

Since the mean and variance of naturalistic stimuli are correlated over

 mean or the variance (or to some other statistic) of preceding whiffs.
 To determine how changing one moment of the stimulus distribution changed
 ORN gain, and to disambiguate the effect of receptor saturation from adaptation
, we proceeded to other experiments using Gaussian stimuli with changing
 means (Fig.

 various combinations.

Modularity of gain control at transduction and spiking 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since spiking occurs downstream of transduction, Weber-Fechner gain scaling
 at transduction ensures that fluctuations in the input to the spiking machinery
 occur at the same scale, independent of the scale of the stimulus.
 Can spiking gain change to amplify or suppress transduction responses?
 To decouple the overall drive to the neuron from Weber-Fechner gain control
 at transduction, we expressed Chrimson channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Klapoetke:2014ja"

\end_inset

 in ab3A ORNs and activated them using red light.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we used a fluctuating ethyl acetate stimulus to probe transduction
 and ORN gain while increasing the neuron’s firing rate using increasing
 backgrounds of red light (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

a-b).
 While increasing light levels elicited increasing firing rates (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

b inset), ORN and transduction gain did not vary with the intensity of supplemen
tal light (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

a-b).
 This suggests that constitutive spiking activity does not feed back onto
 LFP adaptation, or overall ORN gain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we used a fluctuating light stimulus to probe the spiking gain while
 stimulating the ORN and its receptors with increasing backgrounds of ethyl
 acetate odorant (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

c-d).
 While ethyl acetate backgrounds of increasing intensity increased ORN firing
 rate (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

d inset), they failed to change gain in the spiking machinery.
 Increasing odor backgrounds moved input-output curves along the y-axis
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chrimson"

\end_inset

c), consistent with increasing firing due to background odor, but failed
 to change the slope of these curves, suggesting that ORN gain to the fluctuatin
g light probe was not changed.
 This suggests that adaptation at transduction does not affect gain of the
 spiking machinery, consistent with our result that increasing odor backgrounds
 decreased gain at transduction, but not spiking (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:modularity"

\end_inset

a-d).
 Thus, Weber-Fechner scaling in ORN gain control to stimulus mean is insulated
 from activity of the spiking machinery.

How do adaptive mechanisms at transduction preserve both the Weber-Fechner
 Law and lead to response slowdowns? In the following we show that a minimal
 two-state model of the olfactory receptor-olfactory co-receptor (Or-Orco)
 complex with an adaptation architecture similar to that of the bacterial
 chemotaxis system

 At steady state, Eq.

An important intrinsic property of this model is that adaptation to increasing
 background of odorant decreases the rates of activation and inactivation
 and of the Or-Orco complex decrease, providing a self-consistent explanation
 for the slowdown of the response kinetics of the LFP upon adaptation.
 It is interesting to note that this kinetic property emerges because (1)
 the switching rates are decreasing functions of the free energy difference
 and (2) the requirement of Weber-Fechner scaling, which causes the adapted
 value of to scale with the logarithm of the mean signal intensity (see
 Methods).

\begin_layout Standard
Since the spiking machinery compensates for the slowdown in LFP responses
 to preserve the timing of odorant encounters, we wondered if a simplification
 of this model that ignores the slowdown of the LFP kinetics upon adaptation
 could be used to predict firing rate: 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{F}=N(K_{F}\otimes\bar{a}(S,\varepsilon))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 is a static nonlinearity, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{F}$

 a partially derivative taking linear filter (

 obeying eq.

 This simplification reduces this model to a type of adaptive nonlinear

 the firing rates of ORN in response to both naturalistic and Gaussian Stimuli

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this work was to study how ORNs encode naturalistic odor signals,
 characterizing how gain control in ORNs is modulated dynamically in response
 to stimuli.
 By using precisely controlled, repeatable odorant stimuli, and linear modeling,
 we found that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout aEnumerate (ClassicThesis)
ORN gain varies dynamically during responses to naturalistic stimuli, suppressin
g responses to whiffs following earlier whiffs (Figs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout aEnumerate (ClassicThesis)
Gain varies inversely with the mean stimulus (Weber-Fechner Law) and can
 also decrease with increasing stimulus variance (Figs.

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout aEnumerate (ClassicThesis)
Variance gain control occurs at both transduction and spiking, while mean
 gain control occurs only at transduction (Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout aEnumerate (ClassicThesis)
While gain control slows stimulus-to-transduction kinetics, this is compensated
 for by a corresponding speed up of transduction-to-spiking kinetics, therefore
 maintaining the stimulus-to-firing rate kinetics relatively unaffected

 However, a clear identification of the law in the firing rate of ORNs has
 remained elusive, due to difficulties in controlling and measuring odor
 stimuli in gas phase simultaneously with ORN firing rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cafaro:2016ed,Martelli:2013it"

 Here we directly measured ORN firing rate and stimulus intensity and found
 that the ORN firing rate exhibited Weber-Fechner gain scaling relative
 to the mean stimulus intensity for five different odor-receptor combinations
 (Fig.

; however, we found that with their compressive gain control, ORNs maintained
 firing rates between 0 - 50 Hz to fluctuating odor stimuli, even with a

 The ORNs’ postsynaptic partners, the projection neurons (PNs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 While we quantified our stimulus in terms of the first and second moments
 of the stimulus statistics in this study, these moments may not map simply
 onto the salient features that are most relevant to the fly’s encoding
 scheme.
 Variance gain control could therefore be a consequence of an adaptive represent
ation that is important to the coding properties of the ORN.
 Nonetheless, because i) variance gain control is distributed between transducti
on and spiking machinery (Fig.

 While this model can change gain via a negative feedback mechanism, it

 Here we showed that these features emerge if we assume that: (i) the activity

 the active and inactive state of the unbound Or-Orco complex, which in
 turns affects both the rates of activation and inactivation of the complex;

 It is not trivial to devise systems in which kinetics slow down with increasing
 stimulus background.
 To exhibit this property, a system must increase its effective timescale
 of response with stimulus intensity, for example, by decreasing all reaction
 rates uniformly.
 Interestingly, our model also exhibits a slowdown in the LFP kinetics upon
 adaptation.
 This feature emerges intrinsically from the model architecture because:
 (i) the feedback of the activity onto the free energy difference affects
 both the activation and deactivation rates of the complex (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{-}$
\end_inset

); and (ii) the Weber-Fechner gain control causes 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 to scale logarithmically with the stimulus, which in turn causes 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{+}$

and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{-}$

to decrease.

Earlier work modeled the transformation from LFP to firing rates using a

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Here, we show that the temporal structure of these kernels depends on the
 adaptation state of the ORN, and must take derivatives on shorter timescales
 at higher stimuli to compensate for slowing transduction kinetics.
 While the mechanism of this speed up is not known, the neuron’s ability
 to spike with shorter latencies could depend on the adapted state of its
 receptors, the level of intracellular calcium, or the distance of its membrane
 potential from firing thresholds.

 of 100 ms (at the cost of very fast stimulus control).
 An odorized airstream (0-200 mL/min) was fed into a main airstream (2 L/min)
 that was delivered through a glass tube positioned within 10mm of the fly’s
 antenna.
 The secondary airstream passed through a scintillation vial with a machined
 plastic screw-top lid containing pure odorant.
 Using pure odorant and gas phase dilution permitted excellent reproducibility
 of the odor stimulus.
 All tubing was made of chemical-resistant PTFE tubing (McMaster Carr, stock

 to the LFP, 2) firing gains, from the LFP to the firing rate, and 3) overall
 ORN gains, from the stimulus to the firing rate.
 Transduction gain had units of (mV/V) since deflections in LFP are measured
 in mV and the stimulus is measured in V.
 Similarly, firing gain had units of Hz/mV.
 Overall ORN gain had units of Hz/V when stimulating ORNs with fluctuating
 odor, and had units of Hz/
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{\mu W}$
\end_inset

 when stimulating with light.
 In experiments where we changed the variance (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance"

\end_inset

), low-variance epochs tended to have a mean stimulus ~8% higher than high-varia
nce epochs (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance-supp"

\end_inset

), despite our best efforts to keep the stimulus mean the same.
 To estimate gain changes solely due to the change in stimulus variance,
 we divided the projected stimulus by the mean stimulus in each epoch in
 each trial (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance"

\end_inset

e).
 Differences in gain between high- and low-variance epochs remain significant
 even without this correction (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance-supp"

\end_inset

b-c).
 A single filter was used to project stimuli in both low- and high-variance
 epochs; changes in gain from low- to high-variance stimuli thus appear
 solely in the nonlinearity (Fig.

Measuring lags.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all our data, we measured the stimulus together with the response of
 ORNs.
 This allowed us to estimate transduction and firing lags with respect to
 the stimulus.
 In general, we estimated response lags by computing cross-correlation functions
 from the stimulus to the response.
 Lag was defined to be the location of the peak of the cross-correlation
 function.

Estimation of variance gain control timescale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the timescale of variance gain control (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance"

\end_inset

), we computed input-output curves from the projected stimulus to the firing
 rate in 50 ms bins, pooling all trials together.
 This allowed us to estimate gain in 50 ms bins, together with the stimulus
 contrast (standard deviation/mean).
 We plotted time series of instantaneous gain and stimulus contrast (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance"

\end_inset

h), and observed that while the stimulus contrast changed rapidly after
 the switch from high to low variance (at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=5$
\end_inset

 s), the instantaneous gain changed more slowly, but still changed in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim130$
\end_inset

 ms, suggesting that timescale of variance gain control is relatively rapid.

To determine if ab3A transduction-to-firing gain varied with the mean stimulus
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

d), we used a Spearman rank correlation test.
 To determine if gains varied significantly from low to high variance epochs
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:modularity"

\end_inset

), we first reshaped the raw data into trials 10 s long.
 Each trial consisted of a high variance epoch followed by a low variance
 epoch.
 Each trial was fit with three linear models, and yielded three pairs of
 gains, for transduction gain, firing gain, and total ORN gain.
 We discarded all trials where any linear model fit was poorly correlated
 with data, retaining only trials where all fits had high correlations with
 data (
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}>0.8$
\end_inset

, see Fig.

 We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test on these tuples to determine if the
 difference in gains in the low and high variance epochs was statistically
 significant.

Stimulus binding and the activity of the Or-Orco complexes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that Or and Orco form a complex that can exist in two conformations
 that can bind ligand.
 The concentration of unbound active complexes is C* and that of unbound
 inactive one is C.
 The corresponding concentrations for the bound complexes are C*S and CS
 (Fig.

 The fraction of active Or-Orco complexes is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a=\frac{C*+C*S}{C+CS+C*+C*S}
\]

\end_inset

(Un)binding of odorant is taken to be much faster than the (in)activation.
 Thus, the probability to be bound in the active and inactive cases are

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\textrm{on}}<K_{\textrm{off}}$

 are the dissociation constants for each state.
 Let the free energy difference in units of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

 between the active and inactive states be 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{b}$
\end_inset

 when unbound and when bound, respectively.
 For simplicity, we assume detailed balance (this can easily be relaxed
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\emph on

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{b}=\varepsilon+\log(K_{\textrm{on}}/K_{\textrm{off}})$

 The activation kinetics can then be described by

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{\pm}^{b}=\frac{\alpha}{1+e^{\pm\varepsilon^{b}}}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We constrained the energy barrier between the active and inactive conformations
 by making the simplifying assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{+}^{u}+w_{-}^{u}=\alpha=w_{-}^{b}+w_{-}^{b}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is an intrinsic switching rate (see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 From these considerations we can then derive Eq.

 We model adaptation assuming that the activity feeds back onto the free
 energy difference with rates that depend only on the activity (the effective
 switching rate is constant):

 is the rate of adaptation.
 Note that the free energy is bounded both from below and from above.
 In practice, we only need the lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{L}<\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 At steady state (for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 high enough that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{L}<\varepsilon$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{a}=a_{0}$

Thus, at steady state, adaptation causes the free energy difference of the
 complex to increase with the logarithm of the background signal intensity.
