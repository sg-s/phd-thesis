\begin_layout Section
Insects and the sense of smell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olfaction — the sense of smell — is a key sensory modality in animals.
 Insects use olfaction to find food, mates and to navigate the world.
 Mosquitoes use thier sense of smell to detect a variety of volatiale molecules
 produced by humans and animals, especially carbon dioxide, to find hosts
 to feed on

.
 Male moths use specialised, equisitely sensitive neurons on their antenna
 to detect molecules of phereonome realeased by female moths and find them

 Insects – either as pests or pollinators of crops – play a large role human
 welfare and olfaction plays a key role in their behavior.

Anatomy of the olfactory system 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insects sense olfactory stimuli 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
specialised, diverse receptors, generic neurons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Drosophila as model organism 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Drosophila as a model organism.
 the need for a model organism – many different varieties of insects – can't
 study them all – but we have all these awesome tools in drosohila – genetics.
 easy of growing them – similarity of drosophila olfactroy system to other
 insects – evolutionaryily consered.
 small olfactroy system (onl ~60 ORNs) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The olfactory world of insects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
what would they smell flying around? whiffs? intermittentent plumes.
 flight and the complication that poses.
 dense abckgrounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intrinsic Temporal kinetics of odorants - the difference between olfaction
 in insects and mammals – mammals breate, and kinetics of olfaction are
 dominated by the respiratory cycle – insects are different – their ORNs
 are exposed to the air – irectly exposed to all kinetics of odorants in
 free air (exceptions? moths and fanning – kevin daly – but other insects
 fly, and flap their wings very quickly– so doesn't affect this) insect
 ORNs unqieuly located (physically) to know about fast kinetics of odorants
 in the air (Rinberg papaer about fluid mechanisc corckroach) Intrionisc
 temporal kinetics affect response of orns (carlotta)

Representation of odorants in ORN responses

\begin_layout Standard
Adaptation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ORN Response phnemonology 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How do ORNs respond to odorants? Complex spatio temoral code - what each
 receptor detects – Some specific receptors (phermonones, Co2), some generalist
 - ORs detect fruits, IR detect pheromones, Grs detect tastnts - Dose-response
 of ORs -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Odor representations downstream of ORNs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
going down to PNs – what happens in PNs – glomeruli – then downstream, mushroom
 body – 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A quantitiative understanding of ORN response and adaptation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
what are the key questions: how do ORNs respond to individual pulses of
 odorant? to steps? to steps on background? what is adaptation?
